    <h2>Click on the buttons below to see the two sites I chose to analyze</h2>
    <div class="buttonCont">
      <a href="https://tdingsun.github.io/justine/" class="button">7 Poems</a>
      <a href="https://orb.farm/" class="button">Orb.Farm</a>

      <h1 class="title1">Information Design</h1>
      The first website that I found interesting was 7 Poems. Its interface is
      super original, very different from what we usually see. There are no
      clear instructions, and the structure is strange, which encourages us to
      explore the page on our own. You quickly understand that you have to click
      on the rectangles to make the poems appear, word by word with a sound
      effect for each word. The sound stops when the poem stops. This web-site
      is more focused on atmosphere and poetry than on understanding. In
      contrast, Orb.Farm is more logical. There are no explanations either, but
      it’s easier to figure out what to do. In the center, there is an empty
      aquarium that you can fill with the elements at the top right. It’s an
      almost scientific site, where the elements interact naturally. You can
      build a small ecosystem and watch how it works. Both of these sites are
      very contemplative. You interact by guessing what to do. 7 Poems is more
      artistic and mysterious, while Orb.Farm is clearer and easier to
      understand thanks to its interface.

    <div class="para2">
      <h1 class="title2">Mapping</h1>
      The mapping in 7 Poems is kind of unusual. When you click, things happen
      that you don’t really expect. That makes the experience more surprising
      and poetic. You can read the poems, but you have to really focus and keep
      your eyes on the screen. In Orb.Farm, the mapping is much simpler. For
      example, if you click on “sand,” it adds sand, if you click on “fish,” it
      adds a fish. The actions are logical and easy to understand. While
      Orb.Farm is all about logic, 7 Poems is more artistic and personal.

    <div class="para3">
      <h1 class="title3">Characterization</h1>
      The interface of 7 Poems is very simple, with only two colors. It creates
      a mysterious feeling, like reading someone’s secret diary. Orb.Farm has a
      colder and less personal interface. The pixel art style makes it feel more
      like a video game, so the website feels more usual. It really shows how
      the interface can completely change the way we see and feel a website.
    </div>
    <div class="para4">
      <h1 class="title4">Feedback</h1>
      In 7 Poems, the feedback is slow and calm. It makes the atmosphere
      peaceful. In Orb.Farm, the animations are fast and full of energy. The
      elements fall quickly when you place them and keep moving. It’s a
      continuous animation that makes the site feel more alive and immersive.
      The difference in feedback shows how movement and timing can completely
      change how we feel when we interact with a website.

    <div class="para5">
      <h1 class="title5">To conclude</h1>
      Both website really attracted me with their ui, even if they’re really
      different, they both show how ui design is important and how mapping,
      interface, and feedback shape the aesthetic and the experience of the
      website witch I found amazing. 7Poems made me feel like in was entering in
      someone secret garden, it was calm and peaceful, Orb.Farm made me feel
      like I was playing a game but also experiencing a scientific experience.
      Two completely different world just as interesting !
